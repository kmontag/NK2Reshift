## NK2Reshift

This is an Ableton Live control surface script for the [Korg
nanoKONTROL2](https://www.korg.com/us/products/computergear/nanokontrol2/).

It's a replica of dynamiiic's excellent
[NanoKontrol2Shift](https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=193316).
It uses more recent Live APIs to provide some usability benefits, for
example:

- more consistent LED behavior, for example when changing modes
  or working with the clip matrix.
- blinking LEDs to represent playing/triggered clips.
- device identification, so the session ring ("red box") is only
  visible when the nanoKONTROL2 is actually connected.

This script supports Live 11. Earlier versions of Live are not supported.

### Usage

Usage is the same as NanoKontrol2Shfit:

> It loads in a default or initial mode and there are 3 modes buttons:
>
> - STOP: Shift Mode
> - PLAY: Alt Mode
> - RECORD: Ctrl Mode
>   Press one of them to enter that mode, pressing again will deactivate it and return to the initial mode. If you have one mode active and press other mode button, simply it deactivates the first and activates the second.

### Installation

- Download or clone this repository and place it under `Remote
Scripts` in your Live User Library. (If you don't know your User
  Library location, you can find it under `Library` in Live's settings
  dialog.)
- Start or restart Live.
- In the Live settings dialog under `Link/Tempo/MIDI`, choose
  `NK2Reshift` as one of your control surfaces.
- Make sure your nanoKONTROL2 device is plugged in, and select the
  nanoKONTROL2 ports for the control surface input/output.

### Configuration

To configure the nanoKONTROL2 for use with this script, hold the `SET`
and `STOP` buttons while plugging it in. This is the setup for Live
integration recommended in the nanoKONTROL2 manual (so it also works
with the built-in MackieControl control surface script).

Note that this default configuration is **not** the same as the one
expected by the original NanoKontrol2Shift. If you want to use the
[NanoKontrol2Shift
configuration](https://sonicbloom.net/free-midi-remote-script-apc-emulation-for-korg-nanokontrol-2/)
instead, create a file called `configuration_local.py` in this
directory, containing:

```python
# configuration_local.py
from .configuration import NanoKontrol2ShiftConfiguration

configuration = NanoKontrol2ShiftConfiguration()
```

Alternatively, you can provide a custom mapping by exporting any
`configuration` from `configuration_local.py`, for example:

```python
# configuration_local.py
from .configuration import cc_button, Configuration

configuration = Configuration(
    track_left_button=cc_button(50),
    track_right_button=cc_button(51),
    # ...
)
```

See [configuration.py](configuration.py) for more details and the full list of settings.
